# Yelp_Prediction

Goal of this project is to implement Linear Regression and predict how a restaurant rating can be effected by adding few more features to the restaurant.


Data Set:
Yelp data set can be downloaded from https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset.


Algorithms Used:
. Linear Regression:

We started working with Linear Regression. But the results were not impressive. So decided to move with other algorithms.
Results of the Linear Regression can be seen below
